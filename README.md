LOGIN FORM AUTHENTICATION-WEB DEVELOPMENT PROJECT 
This project involves the creation of a user authentication system through a login and signup form.
The form's purpose is to allow users to either log in to an existing account or create a new account. 
The interface is designed to be simple and user-friendly, using the "Poppins" font from Google Fonts and a clean layout.

Key Features: 
1)Toggle between Login and Signup: Users can switch between the login and signup forms by clicking on the "Signup" or "Login" links, which triggers a smooth transition between the two forms. 
2)Password Visibility Toggle: The "eye" icon allows users to toggle password visibility, showing or hiding the password characters while typing.
3)Form Validation: The signup form includes a basic password length validation, alerting users if their chosen password is not at least 8 characters long.
4)Stylish Design: The design employs a modern and clean aesthetic with a color scheme that blends well with the form's purpose. 
5)Redirect after Submission: After successful submission of the forms, users are redirected to a hypothetical "pickAbook.html" page. 
In a real application, this redirection could be used to authenticate and authorize users, granting access to protected areas of the website.

Overall, this project focuses on the frontend aspect of user authentication. For a complete solution, you would typically need to connect the frontend to a backend server for processing user data securely, handling sessions, and managing user accounts.
